#### BIG O

> Important Concepts

1. Growth w.r.t input 
- As the input grows, more computation is required

2. Constants are dropped
- N = 1     : O(10 * N) = 1, O(N^2) = 1
- N = 10    : O(10 * N) = 100, O(N^2) = 100
- N = 100   : O(10 * N) = 1000, O(N^2) = 10000
- It is meant to describe the upper bound (growth) of the algorithm

3. Worst case scenario is considered
