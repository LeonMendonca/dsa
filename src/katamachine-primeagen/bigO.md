#### BIG O

> Important Concepts

1. Growth w.r.t input 
- As the input grows, more computation is required

2. Constants are dropped
- N = 1     : O(10 * N) = 10, O(N^2) = 1
- N = 10    : O(10 * N) = 100, O(N^2) = 100
- N = 100   : O(10 * N) = 1000, O(N^2) = 10000
- It is meant to describe the upper bound (growth) of the algorithm

3. Worst case scenario is considered

Big O

1. O(n) : lineary time complexity
2. O(n^2) : quadratic time complexity
3. O(2^n) : exponential time complexity
4. O(log n) : logarithmic time complexity
5. O(n log n) : linearithmic time complexity
